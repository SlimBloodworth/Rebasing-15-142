Rebasing a feature branch into the main branch rewrites the history.
Rebasing moves the entire feature branch so that it begins at the tip of the main branch.
This rewrites the history by creating new commits for each of the original feature branch commits.


Rebasing changes the "base".

Syntax: git switch <feature-branch>
        git rebase main

**Created a feature branch

** used rebase command.

Golden Rule of Rebase - Do not rebase commits that other people already have
You only want to rebase commit that are on your machine that other people DO NOT have.
-> Your feature branches NOT the main branch.
-> The branch that you are on when you call rebase is the branch that will be rebased.
