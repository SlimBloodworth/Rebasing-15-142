Rebasing a feature branch into the main branch rewrites the history.
Rebasing moves the entire feature branch so that it begins at the tip of the main branch.
This rewrites the history by creating new commits for each of the original feature branch commits.


Rebasing changes the "base".

Syntax: git switch <feature-branch>
        git rebase main
